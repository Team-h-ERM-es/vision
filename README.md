This is a simple test project to demonstrate how you can find coordinates of objects on a image using yolo object detection model and opencv.

This project starts a simple http server where it gets video stream from a camera and detects objects in the stream using yolo model. The detected objects are then displayed on the video stream with their coordinates in a table on the side.
